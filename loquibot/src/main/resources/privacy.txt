Loquibot's Privacy Policy describes how Loquibot collects, uses, and shares your personal information. 

We do not collect much information, but rather what is necessary to run our software.

What we collect:

- Twitch oauth Token: To be able to log in with Twitch and use related features, is cleared from the servers once the bot is disconnected.
- Crash logs: To help improve our software in case of any unexpected errors. This includes device OS, version numbers, CPU, and time of crash.
- The YouTube stream ID to send messages in the right chat.

Loquibot uses the YouTube Data API for connecting and reading your YouTube livestream chat.
This data is not shared with any 3rd parties and is used locally for the bot to function.

If you would like to revoke Loquibot's access to the YouTube API, go to https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions.

Please read Google's Privacy Policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy for the use of your YouTube data.

You are not required to provide this information, though choosing not to will not allow for us to provide you this product.

All other data required to operate our software is kept locally on your computer and can be modified and removed at will.

What is stored locally:

- YouTube Credentials
- Geometry Dash Login
- Preferences

When there is a change to this Privacy Policy, you will be notified on our software at startup.
